# Contested Sky

## Overview
**Contested Sky** is a classic 2D fixed shooter where the player must take down as many falling paratroopers as possible from a stationary position. The game challenges your speed and precision. The game is developed using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and showcases a mix of gameplay elements, visuals, and sound effects including soundtrack.

## Disclaimer
This is an older project developed in 2022. It does not reflect my current coding standards or design approach. It was my first experience with both SFML and object-oriented programming in C++.

## Story
Set in an alternate timeline where Napoleon Bonaparte successfully invades the British Isles, France becomes the dominant power in Western Europe. However, a new superpower — the Central Eurasian Empire — rises in the East, eventually conquering most of Asia.

After centuries of peace, tensions reignite when the Eurasian Empire initiates a blockade of Crete and launches an airborne invasion, led by special forces (VDV). As paratroopers descend on the island, one unlikely hero — a Greek patriot armed with a dart rifle — stands as the last line of defense.

With the French Empire fractured and the Olive Republic under threat, the fate of Europe lies on his shoulders.
