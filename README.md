## Overview
**Contested Sky** is a classic 2D fixed shooter where the player must take down as many falling paratroopers as possible from a stationary position. The game challenges your speed and precision. The game is developed using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and showcases a mix of gameplay elements, visuals, and sound effects including soundtrack.

## Origin of the game
This game was developed as a final project for the "Basics of Computer Science" class at AGH University of Cracow during my first semester.

## Development
Multiple significant challenges occured during the develompment. This was my very first experience with SFML library and objective programming approach. Neither of these were we thought prior to the project. 
Additionally the project was on a really strict deadline. All of this significanlty affected te code quality. When it comes to the game I am quite postive about how it turned out, 
I cannot however say the same about the code I had written and anyone checking this should not expect anything spectacular or even 'good' in the first place. For better code I invite you to my newer projects, 
in whiich I take special care to make the stuff funtional, readable and optimized.

## Story
The story takes place in alternative universe where the French army under Napoleon Bonaparte's command has managed to succesfully invade the british isles. 
What followed were many strategic and crushing victories all over Europe, securing french dominance over western part of it for many years to come. In those trying times a new power has emerged in the east, 
namely Central Eurasian Empire. The Empire has managed to defend itself agains the French onslaught and what followed up between the two nations for hundreds of years was peace. In the meantime, 
the Central Eurasian Empire has managed to conquer and secure most of the Asian continent, becoming the single supowerpower on earth. Two hundred years after Bonaparte's passing, the French Empire is on the decline, 
after years of Eurasian provocations, the first conflict in Europe since centuries has broken out between the Eurasian Empire and a the Olive Republic - a French vassal state. On the order of the God Emperor 
Pladimir Vutin, the Eurasian Navy has enacted a blockade on the island of Crete. Simultaneously, Eurasian army crossed the Vistula River and moved into the Western Europe. 47 minutes past 11 PM. Special forces, 
VDV started their airborne invasion on Crete, the only one who can stop their relentless assault is a Greek patriot, armed with his trusty dart rifle, he is the only person who can motivate his nation and once 
great and powerful French Empire, now divided between Binaparte's children, to fight in the protection of their sovereignty. The future of all of Europe, remains on his shoulders.
